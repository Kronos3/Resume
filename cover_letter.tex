\cvparagraph{Dear Hiring Management,}

\par I am a Computer Engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology looking for a summer co-op/internship. I came to learn about SAAB at the RIT career fair on 2/26/20 and read more about the work you do here. Because of my extensive Linux knowledge as well as experience in C, Python, and Java I think I am a strong candidate for the Software Engineering position. I have worked on a long-term project where I am looking to make Gentoo Linux a more mainstream/viable operating system. Through this project, I have been exposed to most of the Linux subsystems and understand its inner workings. Beyond Linux, I have worked with network programming, multi-threaded scheduling, tree-recursion, advanced data-types as well as web-frameworks. My Github (github.com/Kronos3) has over 20 repositories of projects I have worked on over the years from robot control to website design and everything in between.

\par I think that all of these skills described make me a perfect candidate for an internship position at SAAB. While talking with Diego Gomes during the RIT career fair, I learned about the sort of work I would be doing here. Having experience in a wide variety of areas as well as being able to learn new things independently will be useful as a software engineer. Thank you for considering my application, I look forward to hearing from you.
